	1. Pip install django
	2. Created new directory structure where I want the code
	3. Build new project: django-admin.py startproject DjangoSite
	4. Test project works: manage.py runserver
	5. Run first database command: manage.py syncdb (created super user)
	6. Created app where manage.py resides: manage.py startapp polls. This will create models, etc
	7. Defined the model
	8. Added new app to settings.py
	9. To show output of what db script  will look like: manage.py sql polls
	10. Sync with database: manage.py syncdb
	11. Make polls accesible/modifiable in the admin GUI, but going to admin.py and adding: admin.site.register(Poll)
	12. Modify poll/views.py and put in simple view for index
	13. Add poll/urls.py to map url patterns to view
	14. Modify root mysite/urls.py and add in our polls.url class
	15. Added unit tests to tests.py in poll. Few things required for this to work in PyCharm
		a. Add the python project we're working on to system path. Just add .pth file in site-packages in VirtualEnv
		b. In Pycharm run configurations, set an Environment Variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to mysite.settings
